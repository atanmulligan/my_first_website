    <h1>Links and Images</h1>
    <a>Here is a link that does nothing yet</a>
    <p>
        This is because there is no attribute yet. Every attribute has a name and a value,
        and in this case, we need a href (hypertext reference) attribute in the opening,
        with the value being where the link is supposed to go.
    </p>
    <a href="https://www.google.com">Here is a Google link</a>
    <p>
        While href refers to a destination link, target specifies where the link will be opened.
        If nothing is present, it defaults to "_self", where the current tab is overridden.
        To use a new tab, use "_blank" instead.
    </p>
    <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Link that opens in New Tab</a>
    <p>
        Here, the rel attribute is used to describe the relation between the current page and the linked document. 
        The "noopener" value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage which it was opened,
        while the "noreferrer" prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link to it.
        It's good to note that "noreferrer" by default also includes "noopener"
    </p>
    <p>
        This added behavior is good practice for security reasons, where "noopener" prevents phishing attacks known as "tabnabbing"
        The "noreferrer" makes it so that the webpage you linked will not know that you linked it.
        While recent browsers may have this by default when you add the "_blank" tag, it is still good practice to add it when using links.

    <h1>Difference between Absolute and Relative Links</h1>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Absolute Links</b> link to other pages directly and contain a "protocol+domain+path"</li>
            <li><b>Relative Links</b> link to other pages in our own website</li>
        </ul>
        Here is a link to an empty about page in our website. 
        <a href="./pages/about.html">About Page</a>
        <a href="../index.html">Home Page</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h1>Attatching Images</h1>
        Websites are boring without images. The "img" element lets you attach images to a website.
        <img src="Kurisu_profile.webp" alt="Picture of Makise Kurisu" height="480" width="371">
    </p>
    <p>Like this WEBP file</p>
    <p>Every image needs an "alt" attribute in case the image cannot be shown, or for assistive technologies</p>
    <p>
        Having size attributes specified (width and height attributes) helps the browser layout the page without causing issues.
        While not strictly neccessary, this is good practice, even if CSS is used in the future to modify the said image. 
    </p>
