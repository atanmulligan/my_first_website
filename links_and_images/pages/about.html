    <h1>About Page</h1>
    <p>There is nothing in this about page, so I will hijack this for notes on commit messages</p>

    <h1>About Commit Messages</h1>
    <p>
        Commit Messages are <b>very</b> important. Employers will look to see if you can write them well,
        and having a good commit message history lets you collaborate better and fix bugs faster. 
        It also gives your brain a jog when you come back to a project that you haven't done in a while.
    </p>
    <h2>Differentiating bad and good commits</h2>
    <p>
        Bad commits are vague and unprecise. <i>Good</i> commit messages consist of a <b>subject</b> and a <b>body</b>
        You must describe the problem, and then solve it. 
    </p>
    <p>
        EG: Added missing links and added a description to logo. Readers wont read images to people with accesibility issues.

    <!-- Remember commits are different from comments on a project -->
    <p>
        Think of commits as a "snapshot" of the code you just uploaded or changed. This version will be saved so you can look back at it in the future.
        Make sure to commit every time you make a meaningful change to your code. In fact, now that I am about to add this page, I need to add a commit message as well.
