    <h1>This is a heading. </h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph. </p>
    <p>This is a new paragraph.</p>
    <strong>This makes this text bold.</strong>
    <p>But you can also <strong>selectively</strong> make texts bold with the tag "strong"</p>
    <p>The "em" works for <em>italicizing</em> texts as well.</p>
    <p>Code can be nested inside each other for better readability. This is known as <strong>Parent/Child/Sibling</strong> relationships</p>
    <!-- Comments in HTML are written like this, but cannot be seen in the browser-->
    <!-- The shortcut is Control+/ -->
    <p>This is the <b>b tag</b> and the <i>i tag</i> and the <strong>strong tag</strong>
    the <b>b</b> tag is visually similar to the <strong>strong</strong> tag, but the b stands for bold
    while the strong refers to a set of words with strong importance.

    <h1>Now we will move on to Lists</h1>
    <p>
        "ul" starts an unordered list, and each item element is "li"
        <ul>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
            <li>Item 3</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Ordered lists use the tag "ol", but the same for the items
        <ol>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
            <li>Item 3</li>
        </ol>
        Ordered lists are different than unordered because of the numbering behind each element.
